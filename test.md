* Create an instructional multimedia presentation that conforms to multimedia learning principles, dual coding theory, and cognitive load theory, as well as follows presentation best practices and techniques
* Explain why lessons plans are important, and be able to create a simple lesson plan on a topic of interest

## Introduction

We have all been there before… In a class or a meeting and the presenter is reading text off of densely packed PowerPoint slide after slide. If it isn’t death by PowerPoint, reading text off [poorly constructed slides](https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/slideshow/366369/world-worst-powerpoint-presentations/) to an audience is a very **ineffective** way to teach or convey information in a business setting. We're going to focus this week on learning tips and tricks so your presentations engage and persuade, and not bore your audience to death by PowerPoint.

## How Can You Avoid Death by PowerPoint?

Because of our growing expertise in multimedia learning theory, we now have the theoretical tools at our disposal to explain why reading densely packed PowerPoint slides is ineffective, along with why a number of other PowerPoint "sins" should be avoided if we want to make persuasive and memorable presentations. Let's start by watching an excellent video that tells some stories about awful PowerPoint slides, and models the use of 5 principles, based on cognitive load theory and multimedia learning principles, that we can use to make our presentations persuasive and effective learning objects.

Please skim over a TED Talk article with some overlapping and new suggestions on how we can improve our presentations:

Inline markup styles: 

- _italics_
- **bold**
- `code()` 
 
> Blockquote
>> Nested Blockquote 
 
Syntax highlighting can be used by wrapping your code in a liquid tag like so:

{{ "{% highlight javascript " }}%}  
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
{{ "{% endhighlight " }}%}  

creates...

{% highlight javascript %}
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
{% endhighlight %}
 
Use two trailing spaces  
on the right  
to create linebreak tags  
 
Finally, horizontal lines
