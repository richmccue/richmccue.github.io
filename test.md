## Introduction

We have all been there before… In a class or a meeting and the presenter is reading text off of densely packed PowerPoint slide after slide. If it isn’t death by PowerPoint, reading text off [poorly constructed slides](https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/slideshow/366369/world-worst-powerpoint-presentations/) to an audience is a very **ineffective** way to teach or convey information in a business setting. We're going to focus this week on learning tips and tricks so your presentations engage and persuade, and not bore your audience to death by PowerPoint.

## How Can You Avoid Death by PowerPoint?

Because of our growing expertise in multimedia learning theory, we now have the theoretical tools at our disposal to explain why reading densely packed PowerPoint slides is ineffective, along with why a number of other PowerPoint "sins" should be avoided if we want to make persuasive and memorable presentations. Let's start by watching an excellent video that tells some stories about awful PowerPoint slides, and models the use of 5 principles, based on cognitive load theory and multimedia learning principles, that we can use to make our presentations persuasive and effective learning objects.

Please skim over a TED Talk article with some overlapping and new suggestions on how we can improve our presentations:

Here are some of the key takeaways from David Phillips excellent talk and the 6 dos and don’ts article:
1. **Only 1 idea per slide** – Cognitive Load Theory
2. **No more than 6 objects per slide** (including title and images) – Cognitive Load Theory
3. **Don’t read text off your side**, let you audience read it – Redundancy Principle
4. If in doubt **use an illustrative image and short text on a slide**, and then tell the rest of your story via narration – Multimedia & Modality Principles
5. Make sure **the most prominent feature of each of your slides is also the most important** – Signalling Principle
6. Make sure your slides **tell your story in a way that your audience can follow**
7. **Vary the tone of your voice as you present**, and make sure to **pause at transition points** in your presentation, and after making an important point to emphasize it
8. **Use san-serif fonts like Ariel** or Helvetica as they are easier to read on screens than serif fonts like Times New Roman
9. **Use contrast to move your audience around the information on your slide** – Signalling & Coherence Principles

## Storytelling & PowerPoint?

As we discussed last week, storytelling is a powerful teaching tool. That said, we should never forget to put related and well-constructed stories in our persuasive presentations. Note how Don, in the following video, tells a series of memorable and funny stories to help him make key points in his, Life After Death by PowerPoint presentation.

Please skim over following article on storytelling techniques for presentations, and think of ways you could incorporate some of the techniques into the presentation you will make for this week’s assignment, or use them to critique the TED talk you review:

> [7 Storytelling Techniques Used by the Most Inspiring TED Presenters](https://visme.co/blog/7-storytelling-techniques-used-by-the-most-inspiring-ted-presenters/)

Main points from Nayomi’s article on storytelling in presentations (make sure you read the above article if you haven’t already to get the details for each storytelling suggestion, including presentation video examples):

1. Immerse your audience in a story
2. Tell a personal story
3. Create suspense
4. Bring characters to life
5. Show. Don’t tell
6. Build up to a S.T.A.R. moment
7. End with a positive takeaway

## Hands-on This Week

Create a Presentation using Multimedia Learning Principles

* Create a 2-minute instructional presentation that conforms as best you can to multimedia learning principles, dual coding theory, and cognitive load theory, as well as follows presentation best practices, techniques, and storytelling that have been outlined above.
* You can use PowerPoint to make your presentation, or any other tool you like, including tools like Google Presentations or Canva.
* Record your presentation using screen capture software like Screencastify for example.
* Post your presentation video to your blog in this week’s blog post. NOTE: If you are uncomfortable posting your presentation publically, please thoroughly review the TED Talk video of your choice through the lens of multimedia learning principles, dual coding theory, and cognitive load theory (see the Topic 8 blog post instructions below for more details.

## For Reference
 
A link to [Jekyll Now](http://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/). A big ass literal link <http://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/>
  
An image, located within /images

![an image alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/jekyll-logo.png "an image title")

* A bulletted list
- alternative syntax 1
+ alternative syntax 2
  - an indented list item

1. An
2. ordered
3. list

Inline markup styles: 

- _italics_
- **bold**
- `code()` 
 
> Blockquote
>> Nested Blockquote 
 
Syntax highlighting can be used by wrapping your code in a liquid tag like so:

{{ "{% highlight javascript " }}%}  
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
{{ "{% endhighlight " }}%}  

creates...

{% highlight javascript %}
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
{% endhighlight %}
 
Use two trailing spaces  
on the right  
to create linebreak tags  
 
Finally, horizontal lines
