## Introduction##

We have all been there before… In a class or a meeting and the presenter is reading text off of densely packed PowerPoint slide after slide. If it isn’t death by PowerPoint, reading text off [poorly constructed slides](https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/slideshow/366369/world-worst-powerpoint-presentations/) to an audience is a very **ineffective** way to teach or convey information in a business setting. We're going to focus this week on learning tips and tricks so your presentations engage and persuade, and not bore your audience to death by PowerPoint.

Syntax highlighting can be used by wrapping your code in a liquid tag like so:

{{ "{% highlight javascript " }}%}  
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
{{ "{% endhighlight " }}%}  

creates...

{% highlight javascript %}
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
{% endhighlight %}
 
Use two trailing spaces  
on the right  
to create linebreak tags  
 
Finally, horizontal lines
